# quickcanary
Ultra-lightweight honeypot

quickcanary is built on Rust with, with minimal user options. If you need a quick-to-deploy, ultra-secure honeypot that doesn't come with the risks of the features of the big name projects, then you've come to the right place! Your only options for reporting are through a webhook; nothing is logged locally to the honeypot. You do not have to worry about configuration of listening ports/services; we impersonate as much of a standard server you'd see on a compromise-friendly network as you will allow us to. Nothing more, nothing less.
